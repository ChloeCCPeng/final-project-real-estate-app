__Vite Rails Legacy__ is [__Vite Rails__][vite_rails], modified to support Rails 4.

## Installation ðŸ’¿

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vite_rails_legacy'
```

Then, run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec vite install
```

This will generate configuration files and a sample setup.

Additional installation instructions are available in the [documentation website][website].

## Why a separate library? ðŸ¤”

I don't want the burden of having to support Rails 4 in the main codebase.

And yet, after extracting [_Vite Ruby_][vite_ruby] the surface area is smaller,
and it was easy to adapt it to work with Rails 4.

This way, people get to use the library in Rails 4, and I get to not worry about
accidentally breaking support with changes that are tested on Rails 5 and onwards.
