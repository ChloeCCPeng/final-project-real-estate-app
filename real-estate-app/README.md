[Vite] is to frontend tooling as Ruby to programming, pure joy! 😍

This repo contains libraries that will allow you to easily integrate Vite in
your favourite Ruby framework, such as [Rails][vite_rails] or [Hanami][vite_hanami].

## Why Vite? 🤔

Vite [does not bundle your code during development][no bundling], which means the
dev server is extremely __fast to start__, and your changes will be __updated instantly__.

In production, Vite [bundles your code][bundling]
with tree-shaking, lazy-loading, and common chunk splitting out of the box, to achieve optimal loading performance.

It also provides great defaults, and is easier to configure than similar tools like webpack.

## Features ⚡️

- 💡 Instant server start
- ⚡️ Blazing fast hot reload
- 🚀 Zero-config deployments
- 🤝 Integrated with <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>
- [And more!][features]

## Documentation 📖

Visit the [documentation website][website] to check out the [guides] and searchable [configuration reference].

## Installation 💿

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vite_rails' # vite_hanami for Hanami apps, vite_ruby for Rack apps
```

Then, run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec vite install
```

This will generate configuration files and a sample setup.

Additional installation instructions are available in the [documentation website][website].

## Getting Started 💻

Restart your web server, and then run <kbd>bin/vite dev</kbd> to start the Vite development server.

Visit any page and you should see a printed console output: `Vite ⚡️ Ruby`.
